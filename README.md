This directory is mainly copied from the LAINR directory from V100 (backup version from ~/V100-backup/)

- the following filenames have been changed:

main2.py -> main.py
dataset/ -> datasets/

- some unnecessary ablation files have been deleted:

* components/
sinr2.py, sinr3.py, sinr4.py
cae400.py
fouriernet2.py

* configs/
dino_shallow_water/
dino_shallow_water_extra/
dino_shallow_water2/
shallow_water_normalized/
shallow_water2/
shallow_water4/

then modify
dino_shallow_water3/ -> sw/
era5v2/ -> era5/
